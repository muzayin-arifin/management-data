// We need to mock the imports because we are running in Node context without transpilation in this simple script 
// OR simpler: we create a test script that imports the service if we can run it with ts-node or similar.
// Since I don't want to mess with ts-node config, I will create a route for testing again like before.

// Actually, user has Next.js running. I can make an API route for verification similar to test-db but for CRUD.
